For example, they might not only be interested in the two different button designs that were mentioned, but they might also be interested in knowing the effect of a new logo, a different font, or another colour, at the same time as they are testing their different buttons. As such, we would not be performing a simple A/B test, but instead we would be doing an A/B/C/D test, also known as a multivariate test."

Therefore, the natural choice of EMM instance was the association model class, which allows us to determine the association between two nominal targets.\n",

In this case, our targets will be $x$, the binary column representing whether the page visitor merely viewed or also clicked, and $y$, the numerical column representing whether the visitor was presented version A, B, C, or D of the webpage.\n",
