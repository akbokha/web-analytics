For the quality measure, we use the cells of the target contingency table, given in the table above.

Yule's Q is defined as: $\\frac{(n_1\\bullet n_4 - n_2\\bullet n_3)}{(n_1\\bullet n_4 + n_2 \\bullet n_3)}$. Higher numbers on the main diagonal implies a possive assocation between the two targets and higher numbers off the main diagonal implies a negative association between the two targets. The value for $Q$ instantiated by the subgroup $S$ is denoted by $Q_S$. We contrast Yule's Q instantiated by a subgroup $S$ with Yule's Q instantiated by that subgroup complements $S^\\mathsf{C}$: $\\varphi_{Q}(S) = |Q_S - Q_{S^\\mathsf{C}} |$.

When $d>2$, the results become more complex and therefore give less information on which a domain expert can act. With $q = 5$, the output of <i> beam search</i> can be easily compared to the top five subgroups found in the A&B Testing paper. The biggest influence on the results was the maximum size of the subgroup that is allowed. This constraint is added in the <i>constraints</i> function. When adding no upper bound, the top $q$ results contained subgroups representing over $85$% of the dataset, with very small differences between the values of them. We choose for $w=10$, so that the search width of the beam is twice the top $q$ best subgroups. Larger values for $w$ were tested, but they did not change the result a lot. As one can see the <i>beam search</i> is executed with the same parameters as in the referenced A/B Testing paper. This makes it also much easier to compare the results, however one must note that the dataset `df_action`,preprocessed in question 1, contains $899$ records while the dataset that is used in the referenced A/B Testing paper contains over $3500$ records.

The buttony button is not in the characteristic flat iOS design style and this may have to do something about whether the iOS user clicks the more modern button version more often than the buttony button version, presented in website B. We also see that that Yule's Q value on the complement of $S_1$ has a positive value. So Android, Windows and 'other' users clicks the buttony button version more often than the modern version. For Windows users, a buttony button is more familiar, because these kind of buttons are widely used in desktop applications. There are also lots of Android phones that run an old version of the Android OS. These version don't have the new flat design and therefore also for these users the new variant B might be more familiar and more in style of their operating system.

    "### Comparison between found subgroups\n",
    "When we compare the found subgroups to the subgroups of the referenced A/B Testing paper, there are a few noteable differences. First, we see that iOS dominate the subgroups that we found above, with four of the five subgroups containting iOS as `os_name`. The referenced paper only contains one subgroup containing iOS users. Also, the conclusion and results about this subgroup is very different compared to what we concluded above. The referenced paper concludes that visitors who run the iOS operating system strongly prefer version B. In the paper this is noted as remarkable, because the buttons of version B do not conform to Apple's design standards. In the results of the found subgroups we concluded the opposite. iOS users strongly prefer version A. This seems to make more sense, because this button is more in line with the modern, flat look of the iOS operating system. Because iOS users are dominated in the top-five subgroups of our result, we can say with confidence that iOS users prefer version A above B. The one who have set their browser language not to English or are non iOS users click the buttony button more often, which is also the conclusion in the A/B testing paper. The subgroups that are identified in the <i>beam search</i> algorithm we implemented, $S_2$, $S_4$ and $S_5$ are not identified in the top five subgroups of the A/B testing paper. This could be a difference in the <i>beam search</i> implementation, but also note that the dataset that is used in the paper is almost four times larger than we have used. This has ofcourse a big influence on the output. The subgroups that are different from the subgroups that are found in the paper are all explained above and don't need any further explanation in this paragraph."

Imagine having a certain group which would shouw large deviations for a particular class, just taking the average deviations would result in skewed results since it also takes into account the deviations for other classes. This would affect the relative ranking of the subgroups in the next step of this elaboration. Using this particular target deviation component will allow one to compare groups which show a certain deviation for a certain class, instead of constantly comparing the averages or an other statistical estimator. You want to rate the deviations for subgroups, but considering the unbounded nature of the classes in this EMM instance, it makes sence to rate the subgroups for their deviations for <b>one</b> class (the maximum). It could be that you get a list of subgroups rated by different classes, but does not matter for the results. If you want a list of the top-5 subgroups found in the dataset (with certain constraints), it does not matter for which of the classes the subgroups showed a deviation from the original dataset. You eventually want to know for which class a top-group is showing the deviation, but this is an implementation detail which we will tackle later on. In Yule Q's one could simply look at whether a value is positive/negative to know to which class it belongs, which is no longer possible if one would take a stastical measure over the deviation for each classe (i.e. average), which is why we choose this approach (the maximum).\\\\\n",

    "Note that this quality measure focuses on the deviation found for one particular class. The quality measure does not focus on/capture how the subgroup deviates from the norm across all classes. It checks each class seperately for the subgroup and reports the maximum deviation which it found, which makes sense in the problem context of \"A&B Testing\" since you want to be able to present a certain group one version (i.e. class) of the website, for which the subgroup showed deviation from the norm.\n",

In particular, the situation in which 4 versions of the StudyPortals website is picked as an example, and will be examined in more detail in the next section (3b). This examination of the model class and related quality measure will be done by artificially modifications to the orginal dataset, since these versions are, of course, not present in the original dataset.</i>\n",

    "This EMM instance and can be used to test different versions of a website/application, but it is not suitable (just like the EMM instance in the referenced paper) for the evaluation of deviations among subgroups of components which are related to each other. So there needs to be one particular component which is different amongst the versions (i.e. the styling of a button). This model class is not suitable to test the performance (i.e. target behaviour) of different type of components of a webpage (i.e. font, button styling, colours, reponse times, contrast etc.). An other model class and related quality measure would need to be designed for such an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the EMM instance is able to extract additional information for when there are more than 2 versions available. The quality measure asses for a particular group (described by a (group of) attribute values; description languange) and each different version used in the experiment, the target deviation relative to the target statistics of that particular version in the orignal (complete) dataset. It then picks the class (version) which has the highest target deviation and evaluates the subgroup-size component of this subset. The target deviation component and subgroup-size component are then combined into the final quality measure. This quality meausure can then be implemented in algorithms such as beam-search. The implementation has to make sure that the end-user is able to extract the actual class (version), for which a subgroup showed interesting deviation for the target component, corrected by the subgroup size component. This quality measure is then useful for experiments in which there are $>2$ versions of a particular website/application, and one wants to find subgroups which show unusual target behaviour for <b>one</b> of these versions. This information can, for example, be used to have dynamic webpages and/or components, based on the subgroup to which a visitor belongs."

    "Before we can actually start with the implementation of the new quality measure to find interesting subgroups with the new EMM instance, we have to modify the existing dataset. In the original dataset there were two conditions (versions) present.A control version (<i>1-Control</i>) and the experimental version (<i>2-Buttony-Conversion-Buttons</i>). The EMM instance which has been designed in section $3a$ is in particular interesting for when there are $>2$ versions evaluated in an experiment. Unfortunately, there is no data available of such an experiment (done by StudyPortals), which is why the choice is made (as proposed in the assignment) to alter the original dataset, for the sake of research!
